I think that I would like to do something with image prediction. For example, taking a data set of images and predicting new images that would fit into the data set. I've seen this done with before with stuff like goolge's deepmind. I believe that a popular method for doing this is to build an autoencoder for a set of data, but then get rid of the enocoder portion. After that, you can set the weights manually, and the result should be similar to the other (real) results. The waits can even be sorted according to how important they are, or classified as to what aspect of the output image they affect.
I would like to do this with an interesting data set. I've seen this done with generating different kinds of cats, and with generating photos of people. I was thinking about potentially doing it with something related to my honors project, as I'm already planning to use an autoencoder for that. If this seems too simple, I would be open to ideas of how to make it more interesting.
