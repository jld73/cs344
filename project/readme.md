Manual Autoencoder

This project requires the following python packages:
keras
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
PIL

The two files used to run it are auto_mnist.py and auto_mario.py.
The first will run on the mnist dataset and should be usable with just the above packages
The second will run using the Super Mario World dataset, but this is currently hard coded to my machine, and the dataset is not currently avaliable online.

These files should be run with two arguments: first, the number of features to look for. Second, the number of epochs to train for.


The other files were just used for testing/experimentation, and are not a part of my final submission
