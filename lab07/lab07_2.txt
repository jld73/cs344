a. Categorical data that is textual, can take on any of a predetermined list of values, whereas numerical data is continuous.
b.
Task1
train_model(
    learning_rate=0.000015,
    steps=500,
    batch_size=5
)

Task2
train_model(
    learning_rate=0.000015,
    steps=500,
    batch_size=5,
    input_feature='population'
)

c. The hyper-parameters tune how the network "learns" the data. There is no standard tuning method, as the effects of each parameter is heavily dependant on the data.
