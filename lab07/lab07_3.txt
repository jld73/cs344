california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"] = california_housing_dataframe['total_rooms'] / california_housing_dataframe['population']

print(california_housing_dataframe)

calibration_data = train_model(
    learning_rate=0.00005,
    steps=500,
    batch_size=5,
    input_feature="rooms_per_person"
)

Task2
# YOUR CODE HERE
plt.scatter(calibration_data["predictions"], calibration_data["targets"])

Task3
# YOUR CODE HERE
clipped_feature = california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"].apply(lambda x: max(x, 4))

b. Synthetic features allow us to draw connections between multiple inputs, which, depending on data, could give better results than trying each feature individually

c. Outliers are values far beyond the normal distribution. Typically these are removed to avoid them unduly affecting the dataset as a whole.
