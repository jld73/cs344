a. 
1. true, no instantiation
2. false
8. X = bread
9. X = sausage, Y = bread
14. false

for exercise 2.2, only 4 and 5 are satisfied. 4 with X = 'McGonagall', and 5 with Hermione = dobby; Hermione = hermione; Hermione = 'McGonagall'; Hermione = rita_skeeter

b. Yes, unification is how prolog does inference. When a query is proposed, it will attempt to unify the goal with other facts or rules until it is able to get all goals reduced to given facts.

c. The reading never uses the term "resolution", so I don't really know what you mean by it. A search for "prolog resolution" gives an example of how prolog completes a query, and a definition of a "resolution principle", but doesn't say whether prolog uses it or not. I would assume it does, but I can't say for certain without knowing what you mean by "resolution" as a keyword.
