    "I think that if it is possible to create an artificial intelligence capable of thinking humanly, it would definitely need to have the capability of introspection. I think this is quite clear by definition; humans are able to introspect, therefore artificial intelligence to mimic humans should also have introspection. Of course, this question hinges on the idea that AI will eventually be able to fully (or nearly) copy human thought.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more interesting question, then, is whether introspection has any bearing on current state of AI. It is certainly concievable that an AI equipped with introspection may be able to outclass another by using introspection to understand when it's making a mistake such as a false assumption. The bigger issue, though, is that nueral network based AI tends to be highly performance heavy, especially during the training process. Because of this, it is common practice to reduce the input data as much as possible while still retaining the necessary information. By this logic, adding the capacity for introspection would likely increase the complexity of the AI, making it slower to train and less likely to find the best solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another question here is whether we can even choose whether introspection is possible (at least in the realm of neural networks). A NN with enough neurons could build up a solution generating portion, and devote the rest to monitor the process, essentially being introspective to the thought process. Of course, the introspection would have to be helpful in order for it to develop through standard training methods, which would kind of answer the question itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I do think that the idea of introspection is important to consider when thinking about AI, but whether or not it is a good practice or model has yet to be seen as far as I'm aware."
