a. It shows which categories are most likely to be misclassified as another. In this example, it means which digits are often misclassified as other digits. When I ran it, the entire matrix was the same color, implying that misclassifiction was not done in a structured way. Upon running it with only 10 steps, I found that 4s were almost always classified as 6s, also 8s and 9s were usually classified as 6s.
b. The primary difference is that there is a lot more code that goes into just defining the structure of the network that Keras takes care of for us automatically. This means that writing a new network from scratch is substantially more complicated, but also means that you have more fine-grain control over the model.
At 1000 steps, there is clear structure visible in the weights; each picture seems to resemble the basic outline of a digit or part of a digit. At 10 steps, however, the images basically all just look like random noise, with a few lines or basic shapes occasionally.
