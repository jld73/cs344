a. Sparsity is a valuable feature to have in a network as it allows it to be optimized more effectively and to be computed more quickly. We regularize to help ensure that we get these benefits.
b. l1 regularization helps by encouraging weights to be 0, which in turn causes the network to become more sparse.
c. I was able to get 717 by changing regularization strength to .2
