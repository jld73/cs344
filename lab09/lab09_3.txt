a. The Training data set has 1000 of each, and the test set has 500 of each
b. The first network is almost the same structure (3 conv layers with maxpooling inbetween) as the one we did in class, but with more complicated input, and a much harder problem to solve. As a result it performs substantially worse.
c. It's interesting how some representations of the cat basically just get downscaled as the size decreases, while others seem to be finding edges, or light spots, etc.

E2.
a. Data augmentation involves using existing data and randomly transforming them in ways that the result would still be a valid entry in the data set. This adds more valid data points to the data set, helping to reduce overfitting without requiring more raw data.
b. I was able to get a val-acc of .77 by using the parameters listed in the solution. These models were taking upwards of 30 minutes to train so I did not have time to try it many times.
